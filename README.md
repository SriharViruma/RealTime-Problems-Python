# Python Basics: Solving Real-World Problems

## Introduction
Welcome to my Python repository! Here, I'm exploring how Python can be used to solve everyday problems and perform basic calculations for real-world scenarios. Python is a beginner-friendly programming language known for its simplicity and versatility.

## What's Inside
This repository contains simple Python scripts that demonstrate how to:

- Perform basic arithmetic calculations
- Solve common mathematical formulas
- Convert units and measurements
- Calculate simple financial scenarios

## How to Use
To run these scripts, you'll need to have Python installed on your computer. You can download Python for free from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Once Python is installed, you can run the scripts by following these steps:

1. Download or clone this repository to your computer.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where you saved the repository.
4. Run a script by typing `python script_name.py` and pressing Enter.

Each script contains comments to explain what it does and how to use it. Feel free to explore and modify the code to see how different changes affect the output.
